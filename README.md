# Form-Agt
The basic framework for contract agreements.  Extended into a number of languages.

The idea is that the user - (e.g., a private user, or deux.commonaccord.org or source.commonaccord.org), mounts this repo in
their own instance, based on the GitHub name.

So the user should mount this in /Doc/GH/CommonAccord/  as Form-Agt.  You should be able then to pull and push to sync with GitHub version. 

Note the choice of -v0 to refer to the version.  The idea is that -v0 is the "current" - hence no assurance of stability.  v01, v02 should, once committed be no longer changed.  Therefore, when building a real document where you want it to be a permanent record, you should build the document with references to a v0x version.  Of course you can always rely on git to get back your version, but that's messy management.  Use of IPFS and blockchain systems will presumably elimate this issue.

This is experimental, and let’s see if it feels good.

Note=A use of this can be seen at <a href="http://source.commonaccord.org/index.php?action=source&file=S/Sandbox/Form/Form-Agt-US-Demo.md">http://source.commonaccord.org/index.php?action=source&file=S/Sandbox/Form/Form-Agt-US-Demo.md</a>  We expect that soon there will be multiple uses, including at <a href="http://deux.commonaccord.org">deux.commonaccord.org</a>.
